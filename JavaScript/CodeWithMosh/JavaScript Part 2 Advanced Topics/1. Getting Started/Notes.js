/*
What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object Oriented Programming is a style/type of Programming that is centered around objects rather than function

Programming Languages Supports OOPS:
(1) Java
(2) C#
(3) Ruby
(4) Python
(5) JavaScript


4 Pillars of OOP:
(1) Inheritance
(2) Abstraction
(3) Encapsulation
(4) Polymorphism

Spaghetti Code = Procedural Programming where we store information in the form of function. So, if you change one function, others crashes.

In OOP, we group related functions and variables into a single unit called objects.
In the Object, variables -> properties & functions -> methods

This is what we called 'Encapsulation'
PLUS:
(1) Reduce Complexity

^ 'The best functions are those with no parameters!'  UNCLE BOB - Robert C Martin

Abstraction = Hiding the complexity and showing only the essentials
PLUS:
(1) Reduce the impact of change
(2) Simpler Interface

Inheritance = Eliminate redundant code

Polymorphism = Poly -> Many   morphism -> forms
